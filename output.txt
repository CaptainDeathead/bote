          "The golden poison dart frog (Phyllobates terribilis) is the size of a paperclip, adorable, and can kill you with a single touch",
          "would it be considered incest if you were sperated at birth by adoption and coinsidentally met up at a coffee shop in cincinatti and began a relationship, get engaged and at the wedding your adoptive birth parents remember eachother and then tell you the truth about the person youve grown to love and care about.",
          "is it gay to sleep with a trans girl even if your drunk and got trick into going home with her but you low-key like it and keep her number (YES YES IT IS you like it)",
          "sex is like the stock market you start slow and keep getting more and more invested until your all in",
          "When you get a pay rise, the natural thing to do is direct all that increased disposable income towards upgrading your lifestyle.And while you should definitely reward yourself for your hard work, resist the urge to direct all that increased income to lifestyle.Mainly because if you establish that constant upgrade habit when you’re young, you’ll tend to keep going with that same habit when you get older. We’ve all heard stories from when the mining boom ended here in Perth of people who were making $300K a year, lost their job and somehow had zero savings to fall back on while they looked for a new one. And when they did get a new one, it was a lower-paying job that couldn’t support the lifestyle they were used to. Not fun. If you get in the habit now of only making small lifestyle upgrades with each increase in income,you’ll be setting yourself up beautifully for later in life." ,
          "In your late teens and early twenties, it’s easier to save if you understand exactly what you are saving for. For most people in this age cohort, holidays, cars and house deposits are the main saving goals.Having those goals means your saving has a purpose and will make it easier to build that saving habit. Write down a number to target, rename the account to reflect your goal, and make sure to celebrate the achievement when you get there.",
          "Just like buying a house, investing is a good idea but only at the right time for you. To get a proper return out of investing, you need to lock your cash away for a minimum of 5 years.  But if you really want to leverage the true power of investing (compound interest), 10+ years is a better time commitment.  I generally advise that people don’t invest cash until:They have bought a home or saved up enough for a 20 percent deposit, They have built a decent offset balance, They have set a trajectory for paying off their debt at a decent pace",
          "I define ‘good debt’ as acceptable, unavoidable debt – things like a HECS debt, home loan or investment loan. All these debts deliver some level of long-term return: education or capital growth.Bad debt, on the other hand, usually sees you paying interest on things you might want, but don’t necessarily need. Almost all kinds of personal loans (credit cards, store cards, Afterpay, and most car loans) fall in this category If you’re going to commit to a bad form of debt, commit only if you truly need the thing, have no other choice, and where possible, can pay it off relatively quickly.",
          'No matter how much or how little you are paid, you may find it difficult to get ahead if you spend more than you earn. Prudent cuts to your spending can result in big savings.',
          'A budget will show where your money is going.  Depending on when you are paid, you may decide on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly budget. You need a budget regardless of how much you earn a year.',
          'Credit card debt can be a big obstacle to improving your finances.',
          'If you want to boost your savings, you can set aside a minimum of five to 10% of your salary for savings.',
          'If you contribute to super and a savings account, and you still have some spare money, then you may want to consider putting it into other investments.',
